The main issue in this ESPHome configuration is the incorrect use of the one_wire_id with the DHT22 sensor.

Here's a breakdown of the errors and how to fix them:

1. Incorrect DHT22 Configuration:

Problem: The DHT22 sensor is configured using the one_wire_id: one_wire2. The DHT22 sensor does not use the 1-Wire protocol. It uses standard GPIO pins.
Solution: You need to remove the one_wire_id and specify the correct GPIO pin for the DHT22 sensor's data line.
2. Placeholder Dallas Temperature Sensor Address:

Problem: The Dallas temperature sensor has a placeholder address (0x1234567812345628). This will not work.
Solution: You need to replace this with the actual address of your DS18B20 sensor. You can find the address in the ESPHome logs when the device starts up or by using a 1-Wire scanning tool.
